// Assignment: Shifting the values in the array
// Given an array x (e.g. [1,5, 10, 7, -2]), create an algorithm (sets of instructions) that shifts each number by one (to the front).  For example when the program is done x (assuming it was [1,5,10,7,-2])
//  should become [5,10,7,-2, 0].



//
// Assignment: Number to String
// Write a program that takes an array of numbers and replaces any number that's negative to a string called 'Dojo'. For example if array = [-1, -3, 2]
//  after your program is done array should be ['Dojo', 'Dojo', 2]


//
//  Assignment: Random Array
// Create an array X and fill the array with 10 values, each value being a random integer
// between 0 to 100.  For example when your program is done, X could be something
// like this: [35, 15, 3, 39, 53, 93, 25, 39, 59, 21].


// Assignment: Swapping two values
// Write a program that takes an array of numbers and returns an array where the first and last numbers in the array have been switched.For example say x = [2, 3, 5, 7, 6].
// By the end of the program x, should be [6, 3, 5, 7, 2]. Do this without creating an empty array.
